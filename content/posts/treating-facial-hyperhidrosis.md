## Treating Facial Hyperhidrosis with Iontophoresis

Facial sweating is probably the most distressing area of the body to suffer from Hyperhidrosis. Hidrex machines make it possible to control excessive sweating in this area. Treatment of Facial Hyperhidrosis with Iontophoresis is possible.  It’s the most visible area of the body and on show all the time. Quite often a person suffering with facial sweating will find that the trigger can be anxiety or stress as much as it can be from heat. In fact, most patients will report that they feel their facial sweat is always visible. This in turn causes them to sweat more and the issue is made worse.

#### Results for facial sweating

We need to be honest and clear about this; facial sweating is probably the hardest area of the body to treat. For this reason, facial iontophoresis success rates are among the lowest of all treatment areas. There area few main reasons for this.

The skin is thinner and therefore prone to discomfort, particularly at high powers but also at moderate strength currents.
Power levels will be lower, so treatment times can take longer to see results, (but good results are possible).
Patient apathy. Longer treatment regimes, patients get demotivated and give up*.

### About the Hidrex facial mask applicator

The Hidrex facial mask has just been revised. Previously it was a one piece electrode where both electrodes were inserted into the mask on the cheeks.  This presented a couple of issues. The issue was that current focused on the cheeks and less so in other areas of the face. As both electrodes were inserted into the mask the circuit would be closed from the outset. This made the mask tricky to manage.

You can view a video from the Embarrassing Bodies series on Channel 4 Television that shows a sufferer of facial Hyperhidrosis using a face mask as part of her treatment regime. Please note, this is showing the old version of the mask.

We considered dropping facial treatment options entirely. However, we felt that as it’s such a distressing area of the body to suffer Hyperhidrosis, we had to continue to offer support for our customers.

#### Upgraded and re-designed

The new Facial Hyperhidrosis Mask:

This completely re-designed facial mask now has a pliable silicon based electrode that covers the entire facial area. The electrode will fit and form to the face and offer current directly into the most commonly affected areas of the face.

The new mask is a complete upgrade. It has taken a couple of years to develop and test and it is a vast improvement on previous mask. Initial results at this stage (this edit in June 2019) are encouraging and we have had good results and feedback from our customers.

In addition, it also a one connection electrode. The face mask it attached to existing Hidrex cables and the patient uses their existing hand. foot or underarm electrode to close the circuit. This makes set up a much easier proposition and gives the user time to adjust settings.

## How to use the facial mask

Treating Facial Hyperhidrosis with Iontophoresis is now a much easier process.

Simply connect the electrode to the cable, fit the mask, set your desired power level and then close the circuit with the hand or foot.

The voltage should be set low to begin with. Once underway, you can easily increase power to the maximum comfortable level.
