## Sweating on tops of the feet?

If the main area of sweating is the soles then it would be best to treat with relatively low water levels until the soles improve and then use either a wet flannel or wet cotton socks to treat the topsides of the feet.

This is because the thinner skin on the tops of feet are more prone to discomfort and so will need lower powers than what the soles can tolerate and most likely require.

We recommend focusing on one treatment area at a time. So begin with whichever area causes the most distress (normally the hands as most visible). Get them dry them move on to treating the feet.

You can perform simultaneous treatment of hands and feet but as above, the feet will generally require higher power than what the hands can tolerate.

Simultaneous treatments are performed by placing both feet on one tray and both hands on the other.
