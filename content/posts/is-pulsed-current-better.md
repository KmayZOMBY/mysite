### Should I choose a Pulsed or Direct current iontophoresis machine?
Well, that really depends on the user.

The decision to use pulsed current iontophoresis over direct current is normally based on skin compatibility during iontophoresis treatments.

If a patient is performing iontophoresis treatments on, for example, the hands to treat Palmer Hyperhidrosis and is experiencing discomfort with direct current, then switching to pulsed current would make treatments much more comfortable and therefore ultimately more effective. You will not achieve results if you cannot tolerate the current.

### Patient comfort
It’s important to note that not all patients will find direct current iontophoresis uncomfortable. Therefore not everyone will need to order a pulsed current machine.

The feet, unless you have secondary skin conditions, are more often than not, fine with direct current treatments. There are some areas of the body that in our experience often encounter discomfort.

The hands and underarms often require more sensitive pulsed current treatments and this is even more so for torso and face.

#### Benefits of pulsed current Iontophoresis
There is no down side to pulsed current treatments other than some loss in efficiency.

If you were to perform a treatment for 20 minutes in direct current, then you would receive 20 minutes of ‘dosage.’ This is 100% efficient but direct current iontophoresis treatments, particularly at higher powers, can be uncomfortable for some patients. Switching to pulsed current will offer a much milder experience.

Pulsed current is less efficient due to the fact that the machine is pulsing on and off.

The Hidrex ClassicION iontophoresis machine and the Idromed 5 GS iontophoresis machine are both ‘standard’ pulsed current machines.

Standard pulsed current machines only offer N50 which means the machine is on and off for equal amounts – 50% on, 50% off. This means that over the course of your 20 minutes tap water iontophoresis treatment, you are actually only receiving dosage for half the treatment time or 10 minutes.

This may mean that you need to perform more sessions to reach the same result.

### Hidrex advanced features
Unique to the Hidrex ConnetION is a feature where you can adjust the on off pulse cycle. This variable pulsed current setting allows the user to adjust the pulse current in 10% increments (n60, n70, n80 etc).

This greatly increases efficiency buy as much as 80% in the n90 setting. n90 applies power 90% of the time with only a 10% break in power so over the same 20 minute session you will receive 18 minutes of dosage. This is very near direct current efficiency, but it will be milder than direct current and allow much greater versatility in range of treatments of hyperhidrosis.

This variable setting is particularly useful for younger users and patients  with sensitive skin types or secondary skin conditions. It is als very beneficial to sufferers of hyperhidrosis who require treatments on the underarms, treating axillae Hyperhidrosis or underarm sweating.  The underarms are particularly prone to discomfort during treatments as the skin in this area has many creases and wrinkles which can add to discomfort.

Variable pulsed current machines are essential when treating excessive sweating of the face, neck, groin or torso.
